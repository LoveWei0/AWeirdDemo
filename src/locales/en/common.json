  "feedback-1": "Learning from Dr Robert has been one of the highlights of my time at University. For every class, Robert had such an infectious enthusiasm which engaged every member of the class for the duration of the whole class. Robert's insightful real world experiences also added a special extra dimension to the course, making it much more interesting. Every week it was clear that Robert was passionate about teaching and passionate about helping us succeed not only within the course, but also beyond. Teachers such as Dr Robert are few and far in between.<br/><b>-Hayasa</b>",
  "feedback-2": "Dr Robert is extremely dynamic and engaging teacher. He made the unit a lot more interesting to learn with his enthusiastic and bubbly personality. Robert incorporated many examples beyond the required material whether they are from real life or his own to enhance the learning process overall. Moreover, he created a safe learning environment and would encourage many of his students to participate and discuss freely. Robert is very open-minded and you can tell he cares a lot about his students and wants them to succeed.<br/><b>-Mariam</b>",
  "feedback-3": "Dr Robert's exceptional confidence, sense of humour and empathy stand out amongst the many lecturers who've taught me during my time at University. In particular, I recall Dr Robert captured the attention of the whole class with his humorous explanation of the 4 P's of marketing by using improvised props to engage students. I also recall Dr Robert's remarkable skill at active listening, which he continuously demonstrated throughout the semester. Dr Robert is a rare and valued teacher who combines deeply compassionate traits, courage and intellectual accuracy.<br/><b>-Maximilian</b>",
  "feedback-4": "Dr Robert is definitely the kind of teacher students are longing for - he makes an unforgettable impression on students. Dr Robert is much more than a friend and lecturer, he is a life coach! My friends asked me for the timetable of his class and they were all passionate about attending his classes even though they were not his students. Dr Robert’s students all agree that Robert is definitely the best teacher. I'm writing to personally praise the best teacher I have ever known in my life<br/><b>-Chulin</b>",
